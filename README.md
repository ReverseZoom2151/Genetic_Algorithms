# ðŸ§¬ Methinks It Is Like A Weasel GA ðŸ§¬

This project is a Python implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that solves the "methinks it is like a weasel" problem, inspired by the thought experiment proposed by Richard Dawkins in his book "The Blind Watchmaker". The goal is to evolve a randomly generated string towards the target phrase "methinks it is like a weasel" through simulated evolution. It aims to showcase how a simple set of rules can lead to complex and organized outcomes, mirroring natural selection.

## Features

- **Standard Genetic Algorithm Functions:** Includes the core components such as initialization, fitness assessment, parent selection, breeding, and mutation, necessary for running a genetic algorithm.
- **Crossover Methods:** Implements one-point, uniform, and multi-point crossover techniques to combine parent genotypes, enhancing the diversity of the population.
- **Elitism Support:** Ensures that the best solution from one generation is always passed to the next, helping to maintain progress towards the target.
- **Parameter Exploration:** Facilitates the examination of how varying the genetic algorithm parameters, such as population size, tournament size, mutation rate, and alphabet size, affects performance. This allows for fine-tuning the GA for optimal results.
- **Performance and Convergence Analysis:** Integrated analysis functions and matplotlib support for visualizing the algorithm's progress and convergence over generations, providing insights into its efficiency and effectiveness.
- **Customizability:** Allows users to set a customizable target phrase and genetic alphabet, demonstrating the algorithm's adaptability to different problems and scenarios.
- **Interactive Exploration:** Supports adjustments to key GA parameters in real-time, offering an interactive way to explore various evolutionary scenarios and their outcomes.
