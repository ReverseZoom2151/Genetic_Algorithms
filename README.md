# üß¨ Methinks It Is Like A Weasel (Lab 1) üß¨

This project is a Python implementation of a genetic algorithm (GA) that solves the _methinks it is like a weasel_ problem, inspired by the thought experiment proposed by Richard Dawkins in his book **"The Blind Watchmaker"**. The goal is to evolve a randomly generated string towards the target phrase ***"methinks it is like a weasel"*** through simulated evolution. It aims to showcase how a simple set of rules can lead to complex and organized outcomes, mirroring natural selection.

## Key Features:

- **Standard Genetic Algorithm Functions:** Includes the core components such as initialization, fitness assessment, parent selection, breeding, and mutation, necessary for running a genetic algorithm.
- **Crossover Methods:** Implements one-point, uniform, and multi-point crossover techniques to combine parent genotypes, enhancing the diversity of the population.
- **Elitism Support:** Ensures that the best solution from one generation is always passed to the next, helping to maintain progress towards the target.
- **Parameter Exploration:** Facilitates the examination of how varying the genetic algorithm parameters, such as population size, tournament size, mutation rate, and alphabet size, affects performance. This allows for fine-tuning the GA for optimal results.
- **Performance and Convergence Analysis:** Integrated analysis functions and matplotlib support for visualizing the algorithm's progress and convergence over generations, providing insights into its efficiency and effectiveness.
- **Customizability:** Allows users to set a customizable target phrase and genetic alphabet, demonstrating the algorithm's adaptability to different problems and scenarios.
- **Interactive Exploration:** Supports adjustments to key GA parameters in real-time, offering an interactive way to explore various evolutionary scenarios and their outcomes.

# ‚ôæÔ∏è Coevolutionary GA Simulator (Lab 2) ‚ôæÔ∏è

This project implements a genetic algorithm (GA) to simulate coevolutionary dynamics between hosts and parasites, focusing on the study of adaptive strategies within interdependent populations. By utilizing a binary representation for genotypes, it accurately models the evolutionary interactions grounded in principles from evolutionary biology and genetics. The Coevolutionary GA Simulator is designed to explore the dynamic and reciprocal evolutionary processes between interacting species, thereby enabling a deep dive into the outcomes of various evolutionary pressures. It offers valuable insights into how varying degrees of virulence, mutation biases, genetic diversity, mutation rates, selection strategies, and population dynamics influence the evolutionary fitness landscapes and coevolutionary pathways of both hosts and parasites.

## Key Features:

- **Binary Genetic Representation:** Encodes the phenotypic traits of organisms in binary, facilitating straightforward genetic operations.
- **Coevolutionary Dynamics:** Simulates the evolutionary interplay between host and parasite populations through genetic algorithm techniques.
- **Virulence Adjustment:** Incorporates a function to modify parasite fitness based on virulence strategies, inspired by evolutionary biology research.
- **Mutation Biasing:** Allows for the introduction of mutation biases to model environmental or genetic influences on mutation processes.
- **Statistical Analysis and Visualization:** Integrates matplotlib for visual analysis, offering insights into evolutionary trends and fitness distributions.
- **Parameter Customization:** Supports extensive configuration options for population size, genetic alphabet, mutation rates, and more, enabling detailed exploration of evolutionary scenarios.
