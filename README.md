# ðŸ§¬ Methinks It Is Like A Weasel GA ðŸ§¬

This project is a Python implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that solves the "methinks it is like a weasel" problem, inspired by the thought experiment proposed by Richard Dawkins in his book "The Blind Watchmaker". The goal is to evolve a randomly generated string towards the target phrase "methinks it is like a weasel" through simulated evolution. It aims to showcase how a simple set of rules can lead to complex and organized outcomes, mirroring natural selection.

## Features

- Implementation of standard genetic algorithm functions such as initialization, fitness assessment, parent selection, breeding, and mutation.
- Various crossover methods (one-point, uniform, multi-point) to combine parent genotypes.
- Support for elitism, ensuring the best solution is carried over to the next generation.
- Exploration of the impact of different GA parameters on performance, including population size, tournament size, mutation rate, and alphabet size.
- Analysis functions to visualize the performance and convergence of the algorithm over time.
- Customizable target phrase and genetic alphabet to test the algorithm's versatility.
